This extension will modify bug pages on bugzilla.mozilla.org and show test results from arewecompatibleyet.com.

(Note: this is a prototype/proof of concept, it loads outdated test data or perhaps none at all if I've removed that old file. It was developed with the Mozilla Add-ons SDK. Code is in resources/bugzilla-te-bug-annotations/lib/main.js and resources/bugzilla-te-bug-annotations/data/test.js)
